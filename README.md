# Tableau-Data
Project Overview:

    Objective: The objective of this project is to create visualizations using Tableau from COVID-19 data queried from a database.
    Data Source: The data used for this project is COVID-19 data obtained from a previously conducted project. This data has been exported from a different view query, ensuring it contains relevant information for analysis.
    Tools Used: Tableau is the primary tool used for creating visualizations.

Steps Involved:

    Data Query: COVID-19 data is queried from the database using SQL queries. These queries retrieve specific information such as daily cases, deaths, and recoveries, ensuring the data is relevant and up-to-date.

    Data Preparation: After retrieving the data, it is cleaned and structured appropriately for visualization purposes. Any inconsistencies or missing values are addressed during this stage.

    Tableau Integration: The cleaned COVID-19 data is imported into Tableau Desktop. Tableau's interface allows for easy connection to SQL databases and seamless import of queried data.

    Visualization Creation:
        Sheet Creation: Each visualization is created on a separate sheet within Tableau.
        Visualization Types: Based on the nature of the COVID-19 data, various visualization types are utilized. For instance, line graphs may be used to illustrate trends in cases over time, bar graphs to compare the number of cases across different regions, and maps to visualize geographical distribution of cases.
        Customization: Visualizations are customized to enhance clarity and insight. This may involve adjusting colors, labels, and adding relevant annotations.

    Dashboard Creation: Once individual visualizations are created, they are combined into a dashboard within Tableau. A dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data, allowing for easy comparison and analysis.

    Review and Iteration: The visualizations and dashboard are reviewed to ensure they effectively convey insights from the COVID-19 data. Any necessary iterations or refinements are made to improve the clarity and usability of the visualizations.

    Export: Finally, the completed visualizations and dashboard are exported from Tableau, potentially into an Excel document (xlsx), for sharing with stakeholders or further analysis.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the process of creating informative visualizations using Tableau from COVID-19 data queried from a database. Through thoughtful data preparation and visualization design, insights about the COVID-19 pandemic can be effectively communicated and analyzed.
