# Tableau-Data

Creating visualizations with Tableau from data queried in SQL involves several steps to transform raw data into insightful visuals. Here's a quick explanation:

    Data Query in SQL: Begin by querying the required data from your database using SQL queries. Ensure that the data retrieved is clean, relevant, and structured appropriately for visualization purposes.

    Import Data into Tableau: Open Tableau Desktop and connect to your SQL database. Import the queried data into Tableau. Tableau provides a simple interface to connect to various data sources, including SQL databases.

    Sheet Creation: In Tableau, each visualization is created on a separate sheet. Begin by creating a new sheet for each visualization you want to showcase in your document.

    Choose Visualization Type: Select the appropriate visualization type based on the nature of your data and the insights you want to convey. For example, use a line graph to show trends over time, a bar graph for comparing different categories, or a map for geographical data.


    Customize Visualizations: Customize the visualizations to improve clarity and insightfulness. This may involve adjusting colors, labels, axes, adding reference lines, or applying filters to focus on specific data subsets.

    Interactivity: Tableau allows for interactive visualizations where users can explore the data dynamically. Add interactivity by creating filters, parameters, or actions that enable users to drill down into the data or compare different aspects easily.

    Combine Visualizations into a Dashboard: Once you've created individual visualizations on separate sheets, combine them into a dashboard within Tableau. A dashboard provides a single canvas to display multiple visualizations together, facilitating comparison and analysis.
